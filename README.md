# CorrYAMLGen
a Corrscope YAML Generator, written entirely in Bash!  

# About
i wrote this originally because i was sick of manually adding and labeling channels in Corrscope, and just kept adding stuff onto it, eventually adding Furnace module support.  

# Dependencies
Corrscope (for preview and rendering)  
Furnace (for the direct Furnace rendering version)
